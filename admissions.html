      <h3>After submitting your Common Application please complete the rest in the following order:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Menstruation & Ovulation</strong> - Menstruation is the monthly cycle that includes the
          discharing of bodily fluids (typically blood) from the uterine lining and into the vagina. 
          It starts from puberty and until the women hits menopause. When completing step 2, ensure that it is during the ovulation portion of the cycle. 
          In ovulation the <b>Ovaries</b> (see our departments for more information) will send an ova down the <b>Fallopian Tubes</b> (see departments) where conception has the 
          highest possibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Sexual Intercourse & Ejaculation</strong> — This step is the most important and may require several attempts. Sexual intercourse involves the sexual contact among two individauls
         and for pregnancy to occur, penile penetration into the vaginal opening is required. This will inturn culminate in orgasm and ejaculation. Ejaculation is when sperm flows from the penis during 
         a male orgasm.</li>
        <li><strong>Ova and Sperm</strong> — Submission of these two parts are also crucial in the application process, unfinished or damaged portions can result in an incomplete application.
        The ova or the egg resides in the <b>Ovaries</b> (see departments) and are produced in women when they are born while sperm is produced throughout the lifetime of the male</li>
        <li><strong>Conception & Fertilization</strong> — If step 2 is successful this will occur automatically. Fertilization is when the sperm and ova fuse together. Conception is when the fusion takes place and there is
        a successful implantation of the fused cells in the <b>Uterus</b> (see departments).</li>
        <li><strong>Zygote Formation</strong> — The zygote is the cell that is created after the sperm and egg cell fuse. It is considerd a diploid, since it contains all 46 chromosomes while the egg and spermare haploids
        because they have 23 chromosomes each. The fusion of the egg and sperm is what creates the 46 chromosome zygote. </li>
        <li><strong>Implantation in Uterus</strong> — If fertilizaiton is successful, the zygote will move from the <b>Fallopian Tubes</b> into the uterine walls and embeds itself. This is crucial in the early pregnancy process and occurs 6-12 
        days after fertilization.</li>
        <li><strong>HCG Production</strong> — If this process occurs, it means you're application process is complete. 
          HCG is a chemical that is produced in pregnant women and can be tested for 10-14 days after conception. This chemical is produced by cells that will eventually differentiate into the placenta and appears in the blood and urine</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Congratulations on completing the application! Your results will come out in approximately 9 months from when conception occurs. </h3>

      <h2 class="page-title">FAQs</h2>
      <div class="definition-grid">
        <div class="term"><strong>Why could it take multiple attempts to complete step 2?</strong><div class="small">There are a number of factors that determine a 
          successful fertilization which includes, whether or not it occurs during ovulation window, infertility, age, or lifestyle.
        </div></div>
        <div class="term"><strong>What does an incomplete  or damage ova or sperm look like?</strong><div class="small">This means infertility in either the male or female. Male infertility could be lack of motility in sperm
          and female infertility could be unnsuccessful release of egg during ovulation.
        </div></div>
        <div class="term"><strong>What is the function of HCG?</strong><div class="small">HCG is used to support the pregnancy and produce progesterone which thickens the uterine lining.</div></div>
