        <div class="term"><strong>1st Stage of Labor</strong><div class="small">This period starts with regular uterine contractions with the cervix fully dilated to 10 centimeters. This stage is the longest and has two phases: early labor and active labor. In early labor cervix dilates from 0 to 4-6 centimeters with irregular and mild contractions. In Active Labor the cervix fully dilates and contractions are stronger and more frequent.</div></div>

      <div class="definition-grid">
        <div class="term"><strong>2nd Stage of Labor</strong><div class="small">This stage begins when the cervix is fully dilated to 10cm and ends with the birth of the baby. The mother will experience powerful contractions with the natural urge to push. The contractions in this period are usually 45-90 seconds each with 3-5 minutes of break in between. Crowning is when the baby first emerges and it is normal for minor urination to occur. </div></div>
