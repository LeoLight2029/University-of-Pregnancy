    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Embryology 101</td>
      <td>The embryo is the early developmental stage of a human that goes from fertilization to the 8th week of pregnancy. The single zygote goes through rapid cell division and develops basic anatomical structures. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1st Trimester</td>
      <td>During the 1st trimester, fertilization occurs when the sperms meet the ovum and create the zygote. The zygote then goes into the uterus for implantation and the embryo starts to develop. The <b>Placenta</b> (see departments) begins to form at the 4th week of pregnancy. This lasts from fertilization to the 12th week of pregnancy.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>2nd Trimester</td>
      <td>This trimester lasts from weeks 12-26 where the fetus continues to grow as it develops muscle control and has movement that is detectable for the mother. The accessory organs (skin, hair and nails) begin to form as internal organs also continue to develop. </td>

    <tr>
      <td>Childbirth Prep</td>
      <td>This class should be taken concurrently with the 3rd Trimester. Individuals will learn about labor and delivery techniques which include pain management during the birthing process. Preparing mentally is just as important as physically. </td>

      <td>Braxton Hicks Contractions</td>
      <td>Irregular contractions that happen periodically that prepares the body for true labor. They are mildly painful or uncomfortable and occur without cervical dilation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cervix Dilation</td>
      <td>The walls of the cervix begin to thin and dilate as it prepares for labor. Full dilation is usually around 10 cm wide which allows for the baby to pass through. Monitoring of dilations is crucial for labor progression.</td>
